Exercises from
#JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts

which is a lovely, in-depth course at Udemy I'm totally in love with. Seriously. I now love JS. 
[Check it out](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/)

Includes code and annotations from following the course and a mini framework/library/something built following instructions from the "Build your own framework" section. 

(Basically a JS playground kept for studying purposes)
